# placeholder-serial
Easy to use and reliable serial communicatoin between nRF devices and Python, supporting up to 1 M baud rate.

NOTE: this repo is just a placeholder, it will be renamed.

This library aggregates learnings of several iterations connecting nRF devices to computers in the context of the OpenSwarm project.
It is also inspired the practicality of [happyserial](https://github.com/openwsn-berkeley/happyserial) -- and it differs by being independent of serialization method, optimizing interrupt calls, and more.
